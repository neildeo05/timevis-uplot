# NOTE
	- Having difficulties plotting large numbers of points with streamlit, moved to uPlot
	- Wrapped all python functionality in an API, using it from HTMl/JS
	- Fast, can plot lot more points, zoom in/zoom out is easier
    - Plot multiple timseries
	- Plot anomalous points in different colours.
    - I looked at the science fair projects, and most of them have a medical application, and publish a paper
	  - Is there any way I can get a medical professional utilize the tool
  

# TODO
- [X] PROGRESSIVE DECLINE (1000 or 10,000)
- [X] Plot all of them (donâ€™t plot every-other)
- [X] Double click back to previous selection
