# NOTE
	- Having difficulties plotting large numbers of points with streamlit, moved to uPlot
	- Wrapped all python functionality in an API, using it from HTMl/JS
	- Fast, can plot lot more points, zoom in/zoom out is easier
    - Plot multiple timseries
	- Plot anomalous points in different colours.
    - I looked at the science fair projects, and most of them have a medical application, and publish a paper
	  - Is there any way I can get a medical professional utilize the tool
	  









# TODO
- [x] Number of pages should correspond to the level
- [x] Use all numbers in Millions and put the legend on top/bottom (for x axis)
- [X] Show anomalous points
- [ ] Zoom into a certain time, and allow move levels with those points
- [ ] Min/Max on same level
